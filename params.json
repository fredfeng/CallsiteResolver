{"name":"EXPLORER","tagline":"Query- and Demand-Driven Exploration of Interprocedural Control Flow Properties","body":"### Introduction\r\nEXPLORER is a general framework for statically answering a class of interprocedural control flow queries about\r\nJava programs. It allows users to formulate queries\r\nabout feasible callstack configurations using regular expressions and employs a precise, demand-driven algorithm for answering such queries. Specifically, EXPLORER constructs\r\nan automaton A that is iteratively refined until either the language accepted by A is empty (meaning that the query has been refuted) or until no further refinement is possible based on a precise, context-sensitive abstraction of the program.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Instructions\r\nComing soon.\r\n\r\n### Experiment Results\r\nComing soon.\r\n\r\n### Technical Report\r\nEXPLORER : Query- and Demand-Driven Exploration of Interprocedural Control Flow Properties\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
